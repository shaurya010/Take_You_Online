    <h1>Cryptography</h1>
    <h3>1. Encryption and Decryption</h3>
    <p>ption and decryption
Data that can be read and understood without any special measures is called
plaintext or cleartext. The method of disguising plaintext in such a way as to
hide its substance is called encryption. Encrypting plaintext results in
unreadable gibberish called ciphertext. You use encryption to make sure that
information is hidden from anyone for whom it is not intended, even those
who can see the encrypted data. The process of reverting ciphertext to its
original plaintext is called decryption.</p>
    <h3>2. What is cryptography?</h3>
    <p>Cryptography is the science of using mathematics to encrypt and decrypt data.
Cryptography enables you to store sensitive information or transmit it across
insecure networks (like the Internet) so that it cannot be read by anyone except
the intended recipient.<br>
  While cryptography is the science of securing data, cryptanalysis is the science
of analyzing and breaking secure communication. Classical cryptanalysis
involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning, application of
mathematical tools, pattern finding, patience, determination, and luck.
Cryptanalysts are also called attackers.<br>
Cryptology embraces both cryptography and cryptanalysis
      
</p>
    
 <h3>3. How does cryptography work?</h3>   
  <p>A cryptographic algorithm, or cipher, is a mathematical function used in the
encryption and decryption process. A cryptographic algorithm works in
combination with a key—a word, number, or phrase—to encrypt the plaintext.
The same plaintext encrypts to different ciphertext with different keys. The
security of encrypted data is entirely dependent on two things: the strength of
the cryptographic algorithm and the secrecy of the key.<br>
A cryptographic algorithm, plus all possible keys and all the protocols that
make it work, comprise a cryptosystem. PGP is a cryptosystem.
    In conventional cryptography, also called secret-key or symmetric-key
encryption, one key is used both for encryption and decryption. The Data
Encryption Standard (DES) is an example of a conventional cryptosystem that
is widely employed by the U.S. government. 
    
    </p> 
    
    <h3>Caesar’s cipher</h3>
    <p>An extremely simple example of conventional cryptography is a substitution
cipher. A substitution cipher substitutes one piece of information for another.
This is most frequently done by offsetting letters of the alphabet. Two examples
are Captain Midnight’s Secret Decoder Ring, which you may have owned when
you were a kid, and Julius Caesar’s cipher. In both cases, the algorithm is to
offset the alphabet and the key is the number of characters to offset it.<br>
      For example, if we encode the word “SECRET” using Caesar’s key value of 3,
we offset the alphabet so that the 3rd letter down (D) begins the alphabet.
So starting with<br><br>
      ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ<br><br>
      and sliding everything up by 3, you get<br><br>
DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC<br><br>
      
      where D=A, E=B, F=C, and so on.<br><br>
Using this scheme, the plaintext, “SECRET” encrypts as “VHFUHW.” To
allow someone else to read the ciphertext, you tell them that the key is 3.
Obviously, this is exceedingly weak cryptography by today’s standards, but
hey, it worked for Caesar, and it illustrates how conventional cryptography
works.

<h3>Key management and conventional encryption0</h3>    
    <p>Conventional encryption has benefits. It is very fast. It is especially useful for
encrypting data that is not going anywhere. However, conventional
encryption alone as a means for transmitting secure data can be quite
expensive simply due to the difficulty of secure key distribution.<br>
Recall a character from your favorite spy movie: the person with a locked
briefcase handcuffed to his or her wrist. What is in the briefcase, anyway? It’s
probably not the missile launch code/biotoxin formula/invasion plan itself.
It’s the key that will decrypt the secret data.<br>
For a sender and recipient to communicate securely using conventional
encryption, they must agree upon a key and keep it secret between
themselves. If they are in different physical locations, they must trust a courier,
the Bat Phone, or some other secure communications medium to prevent the
disclosure of the secret key during transmission. Anyone who overhears or
intercepts the key in transit can later read, modify, and forge all information
encrypted or authenticated with that key. From DES to Captain Midnight’s
Secret Decoder Ring, the persistent problem with conventional encryption is
key distribution: how do you get the key to the recipient without someone
intercepting it?</p>
    
    <h3>Public key cryptography</h3>
    <p>
      The problems of key distribution are solved by public key cryptography, the
concept of which was introduced by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in
1975. (There is now evidence that the British Secret Service invented it a few
years before Diffie and Hellman, but kept it a military secret—and did nothing
with it.)<br>
      Public key cryptography is an asymmetric scheme that uses a pair of keys for
encryption: a public key, which encrypts data, and a corresponding private key
(secret key) for decryption. You publish your public key to the world while
keeping your private key secret. Anyone with a copy of your public key can then
encrypt information that only you can read. Even people you have never met.<br>
      It is computationally infeasible to deduce the private key from the public key.
Anyone who has a public key can encrypt information but cannot decrypt it.
Only the person who has the corresponding private key can decrypt the
information.
      The primary benefit of public key cryptography is that it allows people who
have no preexisting security arrangement to exchange messages securely. The
need for sender and receiver to share secret keys via some secure channel is
eliminated; all communications involve only public keys, and no private key
is ever transmitted or shared. Some examples of public-key cryptosystems are
Elgamal (named for its inventor, Taher Elgamal), RSA (named for its
inventors, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Diffie-Hellman
(named, you guessed it, for its inventors), and DSA, the Digital Signature
Algorithm, (invented by David Kravitz).
      Because conventional cryptography was once the only available means for
relaying secret information, the expense of secure channels and key
distribution relegated its use only to those who could afford it, such as
governments and large banks (or small children with secret decoder rings).
Public-key encryption is the technological revolution that provides strong
cryptography to the adult masses. Remember the courier with the locked
briefcase handcuffed to his wrist? Public-key encryption puts him out of
business (probably to his relief).
