    <h1>CPP(C++)</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>C ++ is an object oriented programming language, C ++ was developed by Bjarne
Stroustrup at AT & Bell Lab.C ++ was developed from c and simula 67 language.
C ++ was early called ‘C with classes’.</li>

<li>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an
enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an
imperative and a compiled language.</li>

<li>C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to
multiple platforms.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
  
    <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Data Abstraction</li>
     <li>Encapsulation</li>
     <li>Inheritance</li>
    <li>Polymorphism</li> 
    <li>Dynamic Binding</li>
    <li>Reusability</li>v
    </ul>
  
  <h4>Advantages</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>OOPS can be comfortably upgraded.</li>
    <li>Using inheritance redundant program, codes can be eliminated & use of
previously defined classes may be continued.</li>
    <li>OOP languages have standard class library.</li>
    
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Uses of OOP</h4>
  <ul>
<li>Object-Oriented DBMS</li>
    <li>Office automation software</li>
    <li>AI and expert systems</li>
    <li>Network programming</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>C++ Program Structure</h3>
  <xmp>
 #include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// main() is where program execution begins.

int main()

{

cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World

return 0;

}
    </xmp>
    
    
   <p>Let us look at the various parts of the above program −
<ul>
<li>The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either
necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header <iostream> is
needed.</li>

<li>The line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std namespace.
Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.</li>

<li>The next line '// main() is where program execution begins.' is a single-line
comment available in C++. Single-line comments begin with // and stop at the end of
the line.
</li>
<li>The line int main() is the main function where program execution begins.</li>

<li>The next line cout << "Hello World"; causes the message "Hello World" to be
displayed on the screen.</li>

<li>The next line return 0; terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0
to the calling process.</li></p>
