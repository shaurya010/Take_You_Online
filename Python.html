<h3>What is Python?</h3>
    <p>Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL)</p>
    <p>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including Procedural, Object Oriented and Functional programming language. Python design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.</p>
    <p>This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Python programming language starting from basic conceopts to advanced concepts. This tutorial will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Python Programming language.</p>
    
    <h3>Python Jobs</h3>
